# Project-3-Angular-app

I had to remake the app due to some other errors
I keep getting nullInjector Error on exercise 3 and I would rather submit this project with 1 exercise broken rather than submitting the entire project 1 week late
In app.component.ts I have the <app-exercise3> tag commented out because it will prevent the other 2 from loading in properly, if you un-comment it it WILL NOT load the other 2
The only issue is on Exercise 3, exercises 1 and 2 function according to thed instructions
Instructions doesn't specify how to format/style the entire page
